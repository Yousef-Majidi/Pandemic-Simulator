## Task 2 (20/20)

### Project Charter

#### Introduction (5/5)
Describe, in broad terms, the dynamics of the game. What types of actions can the mayor take. What types of views and challanges are presented, etc.

Extended to the end of the week. Done very well!!!

#### Overview (5/5)
Your summary was accepted as your overview (pleace, replace it) and it is great!


### Technical Details (10/10)
Write more about how different components act. For example, you might want to let the reader know that Unity provides a system to save the current state of any given gameplay. A database might only be needed if a leaderboard system is implemented. Also, describe what types of assets are obtained form different asset stores. Done very well!!!

## Task 3

### Use cases
- **Opening The Decisions Window (Yousef)** - Well done. This is not a complete use case, though. A complete use case would be for the user to make a decision. This would add a few steps to this process. -2 (8/10)
- **Saving game progress (Suhail)** - Well done. There should be a bit more info about how the saving is done. I.e., does Unity create a file, what type of data gets stored, etc. -2 (8/10)
- **Opening the stat Window(Ian)** - Perfect 10/10
