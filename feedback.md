## Task 2

### Project Charter

#### Introduction
Describe, in broad terms, the dynamics of the game. What types of actions can the mayor take. What types of views and challanges are presented, etc.

Extended to the end of the week

#### Overview (5/5)
Your summary was accepted as your overview (pleace, replace it) and it is great!


### Technical Details
Write more about how different components act. For example, you might want to let the reader know that Unity provides a system to save the current state of any given gameplay. A database might only be needed if a leaderboard system is implemented. Also, describe what types of assets are obtained form different asset stores.
