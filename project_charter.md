### Summary: 

The game is presented in an isometric view where the player can see their city and NPCs (Non Playable Characters) moving around the environment. The city will consist of different types of buildings that have different uses. The NPCs will interact with the buildings based on their needs.

The main view will also contain a dashboard which will show pinned stats. The player can customize their dashboard to decide which stats to be displayed. A button on the dashboard will open up a panel which will contain different tabs. One tab will display the stats in a tabular format, another tab will display them in graphs, and another tab will be decision tab. 

The decisions that the player can make, will each have a negative and a positive effect. For example, the player can make a decision to enact a mask mandate which will drasticially reduce the spread, but decreases happiness of the citizens. The positives will be mainly related to the spread rate of the virus, and the negatives will affect happiness. These actions will cost the player certain amount of action points, and the overall happiness of the city will determine the action point regeneration rate. 

The main challenge of the game is to manage the viral spread and the overall happiness of the town. If the spread is unchecked, citizens will get sick, hospitals will overflow with capacity, and citizens will start to expire. If the overall happiness reaches 0, the citizens will impeach you and you lose the game. These are two lose conditions of the game. The win condition is when the player successfully eliminates the virus. 

## Overview 

This project aims to create a pandemic simulation game where you take control of a city's government and make decisions to defend your community against an evolving virus.
