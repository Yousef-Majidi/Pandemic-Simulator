# PROJECT WORKING AGREEMENT

## PREFERED FORM OF CONTACT & AVAILIBILTY

Prefered form of contact is Discord. During the sprints, members are expected to respond within `three` hours to team communications.
If a group member is unavailable to respond within the agreed time frame, they are expected to respond as soon as possible to notify the team about the earliest they are available.
Before the start of each sprint, each member is to submit their availability during the sprint, `three` days before the sprint by the latest.  


## MEETING SCHEDULES

During sprints the group will conduct a meeting at least 2 times a week so members can update each other on the progress of their tasks.

## PROGRAMING PRACTICES

The group will follow the Object Oriented Programming and C# naming conventions, as well using documentation methods to clarify classes and their functionalities.

## HOW TO MERGE 

Each group member will create a separate branch from the main branch for each task they take on. Once they finish their task, they will create a pull request which will be reviewed, and `ONLY approved` and merged by any of the other two members, after all members have reviewed any merge conflicts.

## WHEN A MEMBER MISSES A MEETING

Team members are expected to notify the group in case of unavailabilities that are known ahead of time, and in cases of emergencies leading to missing a meeting, they are expected to notify the group as soon as possible and it is their responsibility to catch up on any missed discussions.
