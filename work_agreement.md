# PROJECT WORKING AGREEMENT

## PREFERED FORM OF CONTACT & AVAILIBILTY
Discord and everyone should be available for at least 4 hours a day during a sprint, 
if a group member cannot respond to another group member that member should inform the group of this 

## MEETING SCHEDULES
During sprints the group will conduct a group meeting at least 2 times a week so the group knows where all members are at with work

## PROGRAMING PRACTICES
We will make this project using OOP standards and use comments for each class constructed 

## HOW TO MERGE 
Each group member will create a separate branch of the main branch for each task they take on,
once they finish this task, they will merge that branch into the main and if there are merge conflicts,
they will contact the group so that the merge is successful

## WHEN A MEMBER MISSES A MEETING
If a group member is constantly unavailable or misses meetings on a consistent basis with no 
And this behavior does not change when we as group discuss this, we will contact our professor and see what can be done about this
