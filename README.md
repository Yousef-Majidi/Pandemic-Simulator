This project aims to create a 2D interactive RTS game that follows the story of a character that is going through depression. The main theme of the game is mental health. The story, the environment and the intertactions between the game and the user are meant to represent the challenges that people with mental health disorders face on an everyday basis. Ultimately, the goal of the game is to send a positive message to show how people overcome their challenges and inner demons. 
  
This game will be created using the Unity game engine and written in C#.
